## Github:

We tracked the project progress, assigned tasks to team members, merged the code on Github. Everyone created new branches for their tasks.

- From week 2 to week 6, I worked on the function of editting attributes of nodes and edges based on the drag-and-drop function. These files could be found in NVAL-Dashboard-master/src/pages/new, NodeAttr.js and EdgeAttr.js.
- In week 7 and week 8, I worked on some improvements of the previous code, including the tasks from 3 to 5 above. These files could be found in NVAL-Dashboard-master/src/pages/new, config.json and the isValidConnection function in index.js.
- At the last few weeks, I worked on the infrastructure interface and experiment interface. These files could be found in NVAL-Dashboard-master/src/pages, nodelist and experiments.
- We also uploaded the meeting agenda, meeting minutes and timesheet in the corresponding folder of ProjectManagement on Github.
